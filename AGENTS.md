# AGENTS.md â€“ MacHelix

## Purpose
MacHelix is a native macOS application that provides the Helix editing experience with deep macOS integration. Built entirely in Rust, it combines Helix's modern editing capabilities with a native macOS user interface, offering the best of both worlds without modifying MacVim.

## Bootstrap & Build
```bash
# Install dependencies (Rust toolchain, Helix runtime, macOS development tools)
brew bundle  # Brewfile in repo root
./scripts/bootstrap.sh  # Set up dependencies and Helix

# Full release build (using just)
just build  # Builds MacHelix with all optimizations

# Development build
just run  # Builds and runs in development mode

# Create macOS app bundle
just bundle  # Creates .app bundle for distribution

# Create DMG installer
just dmg  # Creates distributable DMG file
```

## Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
just test  # Runs unit and integration tests

# Run UI tests
just test-ui  # Runs UI-specific tests

# Run UI smoke test
./scripts/ui-smoke.sh  # Quick test of basic functionality
```

## Lint / Format
```bash
# Check code style
just fmt-check  # Verifies formatting

# Run linter
just clippy  # Runs clippy with strict settings

# Format code
just fmt  # Applies rustfmt to all files
```

## Coding Conventions
- **Language**: 
  - Rust 2021 edition for all code
  - Follow Rust idioms and best practices

- **Style**:
  - Follow Rustfmt defaults
  - Use 4-space indentation consistently
  - Prefer descriptive variable names

- **Architecture**:
  - Clear separation between UI and editor logic
  - Minimize use of unsafe code, especially at API boundaries
  - Document all public interfaces thoroughly

- **Commit Messages**:
  - Use Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
  - Begin PR titles with "MacHelix:" followed by a concise description
  - Include "Fixes #123" when addressing specific issues

## Safe-Run Guidelines
- All commands must stay within the repository root
- Network access should be limited to package managers and dependency fetching
- Don't commit build artifacts or .app bundles
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (code signing identities)

## Typical Tasks

### Setting Up Helix Core Integration
1. Add Helix as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`
2. Create wrapper modules in `src/editor/` to interface with Helix
3. Implement editor state management in `src/editor/state.rs`

### Implementing macOS Native Features
1. Use `cocoa-rs` or similar crates to implement native macOS windows
2. Create menu structure in `src/app/menu.rs`
3. Implement preferences UI in `src/app/preferences.rs`
4. Add macOS services integration in `src/app/services.rs`

### Creating the UI Rendering System
1. Set up GPU-accelerated rendering using `wgpu` or similar
2. Implement text rendering with proper font handling
3. Create theme support that matches Helix's theming system
4. Ensure proper HiDPI and variable display support

### Adding a New Configuration Option
1. Add the option to the config structure in `src/config/mod.rs`
2. Update the preferences UI in `src/app/preferences.rs`
3. Connect the option to the relevant editor or UI component
4. Document the new option in `docs/CONFIG.md`

### Updating Helix Core
1. Update Helix dependency version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Adjust any API changes in the editor integration layer
3. Run tests to ensure compatibility
4. Update version information in application metadata

### Building for Distribution
1. Run `just build` to create a release build
2. Run `just bundle` to create the macOS app bundle
3. Run `just dmg` to create a distributable DMG
4. Test the DMG on a clean macOS system

## Architecture Overview
MacHelix is built as a native Rust application with the following components:

1. **Helix Core**: Provides the editing engine and text manipulation
2. **macOS Bridge**: Native Cocoa integration via Rust bindings
3. **Rendering Engine**: GPU-accelerated text rendering
4. **Configuration**: Extended Helix configuration with macOS options

The application follows a modular architecture where the Helix editor core is wrapped with a native macOS UI layer, providing the best of both worlds: Helix's modern editing capabilities with macOS's native look and feel.
